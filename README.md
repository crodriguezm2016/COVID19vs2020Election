# COVID19vs2020Election
Data Analysis on the correlations between 2020 voting data and COVID-19 death rates by county.

This coding project takes voting data from the 2020 Presidential Election and compares it to COVID-19 death rates in the same county. I created a Choropleth map by county to show the percent of vote share that Joe Biden or Donald Trump received, as well as the death rate in that county from Covid. FIPS and a GeoJSON file are used to determine the county designations. A few different visualizations are made, with different focuses on the voting data vs the death rate data. Covid data is pulled from the New York Times.
